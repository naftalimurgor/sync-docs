    # gettxoutproof

Returns a hex-encoded proof that “txid” was included in a block.

NOTE: By default this function only works sometimes. This is when there is an unspent output in the utxo for this transaction. To make it always work, you need to maintain a transaction index, using the -txindex command line option or specify the block in which the transaction is included manually (by blockhash).

## Argument #1 - txids

**Type:** json array, required

The txids to filter

`[
  "txid",    (string) A transaction hash
  ...
]

`

## Argument #2 - blockhash

**Type:** string, optional

If specified, looks for txid in the block with this hash
